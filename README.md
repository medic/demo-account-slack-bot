# Demo account slack bot

Node app to listen to slack channel for requests for accounts on demo.dev.medcimobile.org:

1. Person submits form on [contact page](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) requesting a demo account 
2. A Slack message is sent in #cht-demo-setup Slack channel from Squarespace through Zapier
3. This repository's  bot runs (originally on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pattern-sulfur?path=index.js%3A334%3A112), see [#medic-infrastructure/issues/1170](https://github.com/medic/medic-infrastructure/issues/1170)), that listens to specific Slack messages or slash commands and creates a demo account in demo-cht.dev.medicmobile.org.
4. This same bot sends an email to the person who submitted the form with their credentials for their demo account using an SMTP provider


## Running 

### Create a Slack app

This is needed for both prod and dev.  Consider setting up two Slack apps so you can easily test dev by switching out `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` and `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and having each app point to a different channel in slack.

Follow the [Slack Bolt docs for creating an app](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/getting-started#create-an-app). After you create the app, add it your channel by going to the app and clicking "Add BOT-NAME-HERE to a channel".  I could not get it to work by going to the channel and adding the app :shrug:

Be sure it has the following perms:
* chat:write
* channels:history
* groups:history
* users:read

As well, be sure to enable socket for the app:

1. go to the [Slack API Page](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. click on your app
3. go to "Socket Mode"
4. make sure "Enable Socket Mode" is enabled

### Development

1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/medic/demo-account-slack-bot.git`
2. ensure you have node 22 
3. cd into the repo 
4. copy `env.example` to `.env` and populate secrets - using demo [secrets from 1pass](https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=FS6VLBPCXJGBTFO3LV4R74OA6E&v=v3osjt24pw5ngyirgee7hub56u&i=wzcncuy5igsmg6hbl7hpclrzoa&h=medic.1password.com)
5. install dependencies `npm ci`
6. run it `npm run start`

### Testing SMTP

Make sure `.env` file has correct values and run test script. For example to email `mrjones@medic.org` (but use your email!):

```bash
node --env-file=.env smtp-test.js mrjones@medic.org
```

You should get back:

```bash
Message sent: <22adffea-4fb3-c192-1ec7-6c75d0fe5518@communityhealthtoolkit.org>
```

And an email should be sent with the subject showing which email provider was used:

```bash
SUBJECT: SMTP Demo Test Email (email-smtp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com)
FROM: The Community Healthtoolkit
DATE: 12:11 PM (4 minutes ago)
BODY:    
    Test email
    Good job
```

## Production 

1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/medic/demo-account-slack-bot.git`
2. copy `env.example` to `.env` and populate produciton [secrets from 1pass](https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=FS6VLBPCXJGBTFO3LV4R74OA6E&v=3xw7qcbg2snbgpt3j25bljlmlm&i=lxb4dh4gc45tlvydyny7nomawa&h=medic.1password.com)
3. run `docker compose up -d`

### Updates

To update the service when there's code changes, first commit them to this repo.  Then SSH to where docker is running and run:
1. `docker compose down -v # stops service and deletes any ephemeral data`
2. `docker compose pull # updates node:22-alpine image`
3. `git pull origin main # pulls in latest code`
4. `docker compose up -d # starts service in the background`
5. `docker logs -f demo-account-slack-bot-node-1 # optional call to check logs - ctrl + c to exit when done`

## Logs from Glitch

This may be helpful in trying to bootstrap the app in a more modern environment like docker or EKS:
